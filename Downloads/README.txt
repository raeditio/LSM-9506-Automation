To use the script, download the LSM-9506 Excel Automation copy.bas from the source codes.
All other scripts are outdated and may not work. The code was written in VBA6, so it may not work on future models of Excel. Also download the SERIAL_PORT_VBA (or VBA6 depending on your version) SerialSetting.frm, SerialSetting.frx, PinNumberSet.frm and PinNumberSet.frx. Save these files to a convenient location. Open Excel and enter Visual Basic (Alt+F11). On the left hand project section, right click under "VBAProject" and click Import. Import all the downloaded files. Alt+Q to close the Visual Basics Window. Either create a shortcut for the macro or run it using the macro button in Excel under "View." When executed, the macro will prompt the user for the COM port number. Enter the correct COM port number the LSM-9506 is connected to and check that the COM port settings on the device and on the computer that is connected to the device are matching to the settings provided in the prompt window. Press confirm. Now the user will be asked the number of pins to be tested and the number of measurements that will be taken for each pin. Enter the desired values and press confirm. The program asks the user to place the first pin on the device. Follow the instruction and measure. Each time a pin is removed and the device displays a new output, the measurement is recorded onto the Excel spreadsheet. If the user has selected to take more than one measurement per pin, the average of the measurements will be printed in the cell. After the number of pins the user has entered are measured, the program disconnects from the COM port and terminates.
